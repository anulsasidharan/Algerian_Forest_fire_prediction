ðŸ”„ Workflow 

The workflow encompasses data handling, model training, and deployment phases:â€‹

1. Data Collection:
   - Obtain Algerian Forest Fires dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean and preprocess data.
   - Feature selection and scaling using StandardScaler.

3. Model Training:
   - Train Ridge Regression model on preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate model performance (e.g., RÂ² score).

4. Model Serialization:
   - Save trained model as 'model.pkl'.
   - Save scaler object as 'scaler.pkl'.

5. Web Application Development:
   - Develop Flask application (application.py).
   - Create HTML templates for user input and result display.

6. Deployment:
   - Deploy Flask app to a web server (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk ).
   - Users input data via web interface to get predictions.
